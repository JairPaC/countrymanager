Hello Technology Solutions Center!

These are some notes:

I removed the other platforms leaving only iOS and Android.
Sometimes, if you are using VS for Mac, you will need to restore the packages to debug the application, It could show you an error at the moment of the rebuild regarding the Nuget Packages.

I'm using my custom IoC process.
Using Custom controls as well. Actually, I have my Nuget Package BajioUIKIT (Entries, Pickers, Labels, Frames, etc.) I did not use it here cause I am still in the process of migrating Renders to Handlers.

I have one TODO, I could not finish within the 4 hours established. You can search for it within the code.
